* **MongoDB**: A document-based database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional tables with rows and columns. [Learn more](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* **Express.js**: A lightweight and flexible backend web application framework built on top of Node.js. [Learn more](https://expressjs.com/)
* **React.js**: A powerful frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's reusable components streamline the development of complex UIs and enable faster rendering of dynamic content. [Learn more](https://legacy.reactjs.org/)
